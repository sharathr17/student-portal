<section class="about-preview">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Student Learning Portal is a web-based front-end application
        designed to support digital education. It provides a centralized
        platform where students can access courses, learning resources,
        and academic information efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the System</h2>
    <p>
        The main purpose of this portal is to simplify the process of
        accessing educational content. Instead of using multiple platforms,
        students can use a single system to explore courses, download
        resources, and manage their learning activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
        • Provide a centralized digital learning platform<br>
        • Improve accessibility to academic resources<br>
        • Support self-paced and online learning<br>
        • Demonstrate front-end web development concepts<br>
        • Enhance student engagement through interactive UI
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>
        • Dynamic course listing and enrollment<br>
        • Searchable and filterable learning resources<br>
        • Bookmarking using browser storage<br>
        • Responsive and user-friendly interface<br>
        • Modular structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    </p>

    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
    <p>
        HTML5 is used to create the structure of the web pages.
        CSS3 is used for styling, layout, and responsiveness.
        JavaScript is used to handle dynamic content loading,
        user interaction, and browser storage.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <p>
        In the future, this portal can be extended by integrating
        a backend system and database. Additional features such as
        user authentication, real-time API integration, progress
        tracking, and certificate generation can also be added.
